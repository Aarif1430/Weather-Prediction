To Predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not? <br><br>

 
1) Research question:  what is the group trying to learn or question to answer?  Who is interested (audience)? <br><br>
<p> We are predicting whether it will rain or not tomorrow by using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic regression and KNN models. People who plan their day according to weather conditions will be strongly benefitted. It will also help people whether to carry an umbrella or not.
